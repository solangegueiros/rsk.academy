To have cryptocurrencies, we need an address / wallet to manage them.

There are a few ways to generate an address,
we will do this from a mnemonic in a web wallet.

Here are some browser extension wallets:

- [Metamask](https://metamask.io/)
- [Nifty](https://www.poa.network/for-users/nifty-wallet)

These wallets generate the mnemonic for you.

In our course we will use Nifty wallet.

## Nifty Wallet

Nifty wallet is a kind of web wallet that facilitates transactions with your accounts.

It can also be used with RSK networks because it is already configured for this.
It is a Chrome extension.

[Nifty](https://www.poa.network/for-users/nifty-wallet) wallet
was developed by POA network, which is an Ethereum sidechain.
At another moment in this course we will talk about sidechains.

If you already have **Metamask** wallet installed, you have two options:

- Use Metamask in the course.

OR

- Disable Metamask (go to Chrome extensions for this) and install **Nifty** wallet

> I do NOT recommend keeping both wallets active,
> you'll probably have problems on connections to the wallet.

## Mnemonic

Copy your mnemonic.

> This is the most important part!>
> If someone knows your mnemonic, can steal your wallet.
> You can forget the password, but the mnemonic never.
> Without it you no longer have access to your wallet.

You can click on **Save seed words as a file** to download your mnemonic.

![Mnemonic](/img/courses/dev/01/install-web-wallet/image-15.png)

For example, my mnemonic is:

```
shoot gate legend member sniff asthma smart slot famous call marriage math
```

- I hope you don't steal my cryptos because I'm teaching you :)

After copying your mnemonic to a safe place,
click **I've copied it somewhere safe**.

On the upper left corner of the Nifty window,
click the down arrow to open the list.

Choose the **RSK Testnet** network.

![Choose network](/img/courses/dev/01/install-web-wallet/image-16.png)

Take a look in the selected network, it is RSK Testnet.
