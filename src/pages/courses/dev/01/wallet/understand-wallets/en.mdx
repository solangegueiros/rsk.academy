We're excited that you chose RSK to help in your journey to become a Blockchain developer!

We believe that the best type of learning is the hands-on experience.

We set to accomplish this through several coding tutorials, projects, and challenges defined for you.

```js
var abi = UPDATE_ABI_HERE

var Bytecode = UPDATE_BYTECODE_HERE

var Contract = web3.eth.contract(abi)
var instance = Contract.new(
  {
    from: web3.eth.accounts[0],
    data: '0x' + Bytecode.object,
    gas: '4700000',
  },
  function (e, contract) {
    if (typeof contract.address !== 'undefined') {
      console.log(
        'Contract mined! address: ' +
          contract.address +
          ' transactionHash: ' +
          contract.transactionHash,
      )
    }
  },
)
```

## Curriculum Structure

```js
const x = [12, 'a', { a: 3 }]
```

The curriculum is split into

distinct modules starting with programming basics and ends with deployment of decentralized applications on RSK blockchain!

The curriculum starts in the first module and progresses at a level of difficulty, sequentially to the others. Each module builds on knowledge from the previous module.

The course makes no assumptions about your previous knowledge and it starts from the very basics of programming.

At later stages in the curriculum you will learn how to port your programming knowledge over to development on your local machine so you can begin working on your own projects!
