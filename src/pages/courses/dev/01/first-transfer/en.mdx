Then click on the button **submit**

Congratulations! You sent your first transaction to Blockchain!

## Transaction pending

When we send a transaction, it goes to the node's mempool, which in this case is the Nifty node.

Then the node broadcasts (propagates) the transaction to the other nodes on the network.

It will wait for a miner to verify that it is a valid transaction and include it in a block.

Only after the transaction is in a block, is it considered a confirmed transaction on the network.

## Transaction confirmed

Nifty wallet will show a popup window warning you that the transaction has been confirmed.

You can also see in the wallet

By clicking on the transaction, you can see in the [explorer](https://explorer.testnet.rsk.co/)

Take a look on my transfer:

## Error: Recipient address checksum is invalid

![Recipient address checksum is invalid](/img/courses/dev/01/first-transfer/image-04.png)

In another lesson you will learn what checksum is,
but if you see this error now,
you must convert the address to lowercase.

For example,

`0x91976be9cAFCd18BE7b29580fa783Db92548b79d`

will be converted to:

`0x91976be9cafcd18be7b29580fa783db92548b79d`

## Check your balance

After complete the transfer to **Academy Wallet**,
you can check your balance.

In order to check your balance on the RSK Academy wallet, you need to signed in.

If you are not signed in, you will see the message **Connect your wallet**

If necessary, review
[Conecte sua wallet](/courses/dev/01/connecting-to-academy)

<AcademyWallet />

To check your balance:

1. fill in the **Address** field with your wallet address
2. click the **Get balance** button

Take a look in my balance:
