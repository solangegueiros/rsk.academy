Congratulations! You sent your first transaction to Blockchain!

## Transaction pending

When we send a transaction, it goes to the node's mempool, which in this case is the Nifty node.

Then the node broadcasts (propagates) the transaction to the other nodes on the network.

It will wait for a miner to verify that it is a valid transaction and include it in a block.

Only after the transaction is in a block, is it considered a confirmed transaction on the network.

## Transaction confirmed

Nifty wallet will show a popup window warning you that the transaction has been confirmed.

You can also see in the wallet

By clicking on the transaction, you can see it in the [explorer](https://explorer.testnet.rsk.co/)

Take a look on my transfer:

## Error: Recipient address checksum is invalid

![Recipient address checksum is invalid](/img/courses/dev/01/first-transfer/image-04.png)

In another lesson you will learn what checksum is,
but for now, if you see this error,
you must convert the address to lowercase.

For example,

`0x91976be9cAFCd18BE7b29580fa783Db92548b79d`

will be converted to:

`0x91976be9cafcd18be7b29580fa783db92548b79d`

<LowerCase />

## Check your balance

After complete the transfer to **Academy Wallet**,
you can check your balance.

In order to check your balance on the RSK Academy wallet, you need to signed in.

If you are not signed in, you will see the message **Connect your wallet**

If necessary, review
[Connecting to Academy](/courses/dev/01/connecting-to-academy)

Click on your wallet address on the right side of the top bar,
to copy it:

![Copy address](/img/courses/dev/01/first-transfer/image-14.png)

Here is the **Academy wallet** app:

<AcademyWallet />

To check your balance:

1. Paste / fill in the **Address** field with your wallet address
2. Click the **Get balance** button

For example, take a look in my balance in the image below:

![Academy wallet filled](/img/courses/dev/01/first-transfer/image-12.png)

The result is

![Academy wallet balance](/img/courses/dev/01/first-transfer/image-13.png)
