In this lesson you will interact with another smart contract already published on the network: **RSK Academy**

When you sign up,
RSK Academy will create a smart contract for each student, called portfolio,
to record all the projects you do during the course.

In the RSK Academy smart contract itself, there will also be a monitor of your performance,
when doing multiple choice tests and projects.

> The course is managed by smart contracts, independently!

## Connection x registration: what is the difference?

Just connecting your wallet to RSK Academy is NOT your application.

The registration is linked to your wallet, that is,
you first need to connect, then sign up.

This enrollment process registers your wallet in the RSK Academy smart contract.

After signing up, you can follow your evolution on the [profile](/profile) page.

Once you're signed up,
when you connect your wallet to RSK Academy,
your student profile will automatically be loaded.

## Do the application for **RSK Academy**

To apply for RSK Academy,
you will submit a transaction by executing a function in the RSK Academy smart contract.

Click on the **Subscribe** button

<SubscribeAcademy contractName='Developer' />

Your web wallet will open a popup window to confirm the transaction.

![Nifty subscribe to academy](/img/courses/dev/01/subscribe-to-academy/image-01.png)

Click on confirm / submit.

Wait the transaction confirmation...

## RSK Academy transaction history

You can verify the details of your transaction on RSK Academy Transaction history.

It is located at the bottom right corner:

![RSK Academy transaction history](/img/courses/dev/01/subscribe-to-academy/image-03.png)

I clicked on that after the transaction be confirmed, this is the result:

![History - transaction confirmed](/img/courses/dev/01/subscribe-to-academy/image-04.png)

And by clicking on the transaction,
you can see it in the [explorer](https://explorer.testnet.rsk.co/)

![Subscription on explorer](/img/courses/dev/01/subscribe-to-academy/image-05.png)

Take a look on my application:

[0xb359542dae0bb9155fbc8a5d3343c7b575a57acd722efedf79f018bc5a9f2852](https://explorer.testnet.rsk.co/tx/0xb359542dae0bb9155fbc8a5d3343c7b575a57acd722efedf79f018bc5a9f2852)

## Transactions on the wallet

In the same way that you tracked the transaction to transfer cryptocurrencies,
you can check the enrollment transaction at RSK Academy.

For example, here's the transaction confirmed at Nifty

![Nifty subscription confirmed](/img/courses/dev/01/subscribe-to-academy/image-06.png)

And by clicking on the transaction, also
you can see it in the [explorer](https://explorer.testnet.rsk.co/)

## Profile page

After your subscription transaction is confirmed,
you can see your profile.

Go to your [Profile](/profile)
and check your student's information.

For example, here is my application:

![My profile](/img/courses/dev/01/subscribe-to-academy/image-07.png)

#### Owner address

It is the address of your wallet.

Remember that your progress in the course will be linked to your wallet all time.

#### Portfolio address

It is a smart contract create for you, to store your projects during the course.

#### Projects in portfolio

The list of your projects.

Now it is empty because you just signed up, you haven't done any projects yet :)

#### Classes subscribed

The list of classes you already subscribed.

In the future you will can subscribe in more than one course / class.

#### Active class

It shows the name and address of the class you are doing in this moment.

> It class have your own smart contract to manage the students :)

When we have the possibility to sign up in more than one course,
you must have only one active.
So, here is your active class.

## Congratulations!

You are already enrolled in the course!

In the next lesson, you will deepen your knowledge of wallets.
