## Requirements

1. Selected the RSK network selected the web wallet, Nifty or Metamask.
2. Have tR-BTC in your wallet.
3. On Remix, at **Deploy and run transactions**,
   under **Environment**, make sure you have selected the **Injected Web3** option.

First of all, be sure that you selected the RSK network selected the web wallet, Nifty or Metamask...

Ensure that you have tR-BTC in your wallet,
as this is needed to pay gas fees when deploying the smart contracts.
To do so, please follow the instructions related to: [RSK faucet](/courses/dev/01/rsk-faucet).

Don't forget to select the **Injected Web3** option in **Environment**, located at **Deploy and run transactions** on Remix.

## Deploy a smart contract on RSK testnet

In Remix, on the left side, locate the fourth button: **Deploy and run transactions**.

For now we have only one smart contract, so it is automatically selected in the dropdown list.

![Contract Name.sol](/img/courses/dev/02/publish-on-rsk-testnet/image-24.png)

Click the button **Deploy**.

It will open a popup window on the web wallet,
to confirm the transaction set up by Remix to publish the smart contract.

![Nifty popup](/img/courses/dev/02/publish-on-rsk-testnet/image-25.png)

Click **confirm / submit**.

At bottom right, we can check the message: _creation of Name pending..._

A block in the RSK network takes, on average, 30 seconds to be mined,
so we must wait for this time.
When the transaction is confirmed on the network,
your web wallet will display a notification like this:

![transaction confirmed](/img/courses/dev/02/publish-on-rsk-testnet/image-27.png)

Once it is confirmed, we can check the transaction's details on Remix terminal:

![check the transaction](/img/courses/dev/02/publish-on-rsk-testnet/image-28.png)

Copy the transaction hash to verify it on the Blockchain explorer

![transaction hash](/img/courses/dev/02/publish-on-rsk-testnet/image-29.png)

In this example, the transaction hash is:

```
0x050e216d2008a896f2e7799fee349c582f3e19bb6017e59cd8b323647624f999
```

## RSK Explorer

A block explorer is a blockchain search engine that allows you to search for a particular piece of information on the blockchain.
It is an online tool to view all transactions that have taken place on the blockchain, the current network hash rate and transaction growth, and the activity on blockchain addresses, among other useful information.
You can think of it as a window into the blockchain world, giving you the opportunity to observe whatâ€™s happening on it.

The RSK explorer is the block explorer for RSK transactions.
We will use the Testnet explorer:

[explorer.testnet.rsk.co](https://explorer.testnet.rsk.co/)

![explorer](/img/courses/dev/02/publish-on-rsk-testnet/image-30.png)

Past the transaction hash at search field, at the top of the screen

![explorer search](/img/courses/dev/02/publish-on-rsk-testnet/image-31.png)

![explorer search transaction](/img/courses/dev/02/publish-on-rsk-testnet/image-32.png)

This is the result:

You can verify my example at:

[`0x050e216d2008a896f2e7799fee349c582f3e19bb6017e59cd8b323647624f999`](https://explorer.testnet.rsk.co/tx/0x050e216d2008a896f2e7799fee349c582f3e19bb6017e59cd8b323647624f999)

## Smart contract address

Copy the address of your smart contract and save it.
It will be used at other times during the course.

There are a few ways to copy it:

1. No Remix

After the smart contract is published using Remix,
we can see your instance in the left panel, at the bottom of **deploy and run transactions**.

Go to the section **deployed contracts**,
locate the smart contract and click the copy icon.

![deployed contracts copy](/img/courses/dev/02/publish-on-rsk-testnet/image-34.png)

2. No RSK explorer

Locate the **Contract Address** line, and click the copy icon.

![transaction copy](/img/courses/dev/02/publish-on-rsk-testnet/image-35.png)

This is the address of my smart contract **name**:

```
0x888be03Bbd234D88dBa228Ef04A53950A2006345
```

## Interact with the smart contract

We have already interacted with the smart contract published in JavascriptVM,
and we can also use Remix to interact with a smart contract published on any network.

The only change is the **Environment**, that is,
the connected network, which is now **Injected Web3**.

In **deployed contracts** section, in the smart contract,
click the symbol **>** to see the datails.

Click the buttons and check it out the results:

![Name buttons](/img/courses/dev/02/publish-on-rsk-testnet/image-36.png)

You can also see the details of the transactions in the Remix terminal:

![call details](/img/courses/dev/02/publish-on-rsk-testnet/image-37.png)

Check that the **owner** is the account selected in your web wallet.

## Transactions on web wallet

You can also check the transaction on the web wallet:

![nifty transaction](/img/courses/dev/02/publish-on-rsk-testnet/image-38.png)

## Final considerations

Congratulations!

Now you know how to publish a smart contract on a "real" Blockchain network, and interact with it.

In the next lesson you will learn how to interact with your previously published smart contract.
