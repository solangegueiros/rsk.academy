In this lesson you will interact with another smart contract already published on the network: **Master Name**.

## Validate the **Name** project

Now you have your smart contract **Name** deployed on RSK Testnet.

In order to pass to the next module, you must submit your project to RSK Academy,
to smart contract **Master Name**.

The **MasterName** is the judge!

So fill your name and the address of your smart contract **Name**, and click on
`Set name`.

If your did some mistake, it is possible to `delete` the project already submited,
create a new smart contract Name and submit it again.

## Important

You cannot sign up for someone else :)

And how are we going to verify this?

The transaction must be sent from the same address as the publication of your smart contract **Name**

In other words, when registering, we are associating your address with your name.

## Porfolio

After your **Name** smart contract was validated by the Master Name smart contract,
it will appear in your **porfolio**.

The **porfolio** shows all your projects submited and validated during this course.

Go to your [Portfolio](/portfolio)
and check your project `Name`.

## Congratulations!

You finish the second module :)

The next step is to take a test to be sure you have learned everything.

The result of your test will be recorded on your course registration.

In the next module you will learn about Blockchain!
