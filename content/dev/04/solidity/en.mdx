## Pragma: Solidity version compiler

How to define the Solidity version compiler?

Use the keyword **pragma** to define the version of the compiler to be used in a smart contract.

Any compiler version from the 0.8 release (= 0.8.x)

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;
```

Greater than version 0.7.1, less than version 0.8.5

```solidity
pragma solidity >0.7.1 <0.8.5;
```

Lock version: exactly version 0.8.4

```solidity
pragma solidity 0.8.4;
```

Contracts should be deployed with the same compiler version that they have been tested the most with.
Locking the pragma helps ensure that contracts do not accidentally get deployed using, for example, the latest compiler which may have higher risks of undiscovered bugs.
Contracts may also be deployed by others and the pragma indicates the compiler version intended by the original authors.

> Do not forget to end your declaration statements with a semicolon **;**

## Define a contract

Use the keyword contract followed by your contract name.

```solidity

contract MySmartContract {

    // You will start writing your code here =)

}

```

## Import files

```solidity
import "filename";

import * as symbolName from "filename";

import "filename" as symbolName;

import {symbol1 as alias, symbol2} from "filename";
```

## Constructor

Function that is executed ONLY during contract deployment.

Defined using the **constructor** keyword.

```solidity
contract NameSmartContract {
    string name;
    address owner;

    constructor() {
        owner = msg.sender;
        name = "Your fullname";
    }
}
```

## Access modifiers

### public

Accessible from this contract, inherited contracts and externally.

### private

Accessible only from this contract.

### internal

Accessible only from this contract and contracts inheriting from it.

### external

Cannot be accessed internally, only externally.
Recommended to reduce gas.

If you have the external function `myFunction()`, you can access internally using `this.myFunction()`.

## Functions

Structure:

```solidity
function (<parameter types>) {internal|external|public|private} [pure|constant|view|payable] [returns (<return types>)]`]
```

- Must has an access modifier.

### Parameters

Input parameters

Parameters are declared just like variables and are memory variables.

```solidity
function myFunction(uint _a, uint _b) {}
```

Output parameters

Output parameters are declared after the `returns` keyword

```solidity
function sum(uint _a, uint _b) returns (uint _result) {
   _result = _a + _b;
}
```

Output can also be specified using `return` statement inside the function.
In that case, we can omit parameter name, declaring only the data type `returns (uint)`.

```solidity
function sum(uint _a, uint _b) returns (uint) {
   return (_a + _b);
}
```

Multiple return types are possible with `return (v0, v1, ..., vn)`

## Function Calls

### Internal Function Calls

Functions of the current contract can be called directly.

```solidity
contract C {
    function fA() returns (uint) {
       return 5;
    }

    function fB(uint _a) returns (uint) {
       return fA() + _a;
    }
}
```

### External Function Calls

> TO DO

this.g(8); and c.g(2); (where c is a contract instance) are also valid function calls, but, the function will be called “externally”, via a message call.

> .gas() and .value() can also be used with external function calls.

### Named Calls

Function call arguments can also be given by name in any order as below.

```solidity
function f(uint a, uint b) {  }

function g() {
    f({b: 1, a: 2});
}
```

## Modifier

Modifiers can automatically check a condition prior to executing the function.

```solidity
modifier onlyOwner {
    require(msg.sender == owner);
    _;
}

function kill() onlyOwner {
    selfdestruct(owner);
}
```

## View or Constant Functions

Functions must be declared **view** or **constant** in which case they promise not to modify the state, but only read from them.

```solidity
string private name;

function getName() public view returns (string memory) {
    return name;
}
```

## Pure Functions

Functions must be declared **pure** in which case they promise not to read from or modify the state.

```solidity
function double(uint number) pure returns (uint) {
    return number * 2;
}
```

## Events

Solidity Events are the same as events in any other programming language.

Event is an inheritable member of a contract.
An event is emitted, it stores the arguments passed in transaction logs.

These logs are stored on blockchain and are accessible using address of the smart contract.

Events allow the convenient usage of the EVM logging facilities,
which in turn can be used to **call** JavaScript callbacks in the user interface of a dapp,
which listen for these events.

Events notify the applications about the change made to the contracts and applications which can be used to execute the dependent logic.

Up to three parameters can receive the attribute indexed,
which will cause the respective arguments to be searched for.

All non-indexed arguments will be stored in the data part of the log.

> An event generated is not accessible from within contracts, not even the one which have created and emitted them.

An event can be declared using **event** keyword.

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.4.0;

contract ClientReceipt {
    event Deposit(
        address indexed _from,
        bytes32 indexed _id,
        uint _value
    );

    function deposit(bytes32 _id) payable {
        emit Deposit(msg.sender, _id, msg.value);
    }
}
```

## Final considerations

The purpose of this lesson was to present the basics of Solidity programing language.

In the next lesson you will learn Solidity types and variables.
