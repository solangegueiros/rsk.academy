This RSK Academy course was a POC (Proof of Concept),
that is, it wasn't a complete course, 
it was just an introduction to Blockchain for developers, 
but it was a very successful experience!

I hope I have transmitted the basic concepts 
and awakened the desire for you to continue your studies 
and become a Blockchain developer, 
who will be part of this great evolution that is happening in the world!

With affection, Solange Gueiros
