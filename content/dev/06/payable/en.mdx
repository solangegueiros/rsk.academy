## Payable Functions

Functions that receive Ether must be marked as **payable** function.

## Fallback Function

// UPDATE

A contract can have exactly one unnamed function.
This function cannot have arguments and cannot return anything.
It is executed on a call to the contract if none of the other functions match the given function identifier (or if no data was supplied at all).

```solidity
function() {
  // Do something
}
```
